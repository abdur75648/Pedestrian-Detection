# Pedestrian-Detection
Given an input image which may contain multiple pedestrians, a pedestrian detection system detects each person and returns a bounding box for each detection


This repo uses OpenCV to do template tracking using 2 methods:
* ***HoG Method:*** HoG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
* ***Faster-RCNN Method:*** This is one of the methods based on the optical flow measurement
